IBM PS/2 Model 25/30 BIOS information centre
============================================

Getting started
---------------

This code has, so far, only been tested on macOS, but it should
work easily on other Linux or Unix types of systems, or inside
Cygwin.

Currently the assembler used is uasm, which you will need to
install with `brew install uasm`. In theory, other assemblers
could be used.

Run `make` to build the `splice` program and several other
utilities.

Run `./get_roms.sh` to download the necessary ROMs. The sources
for these ROMs is in `doc/manifest.txt`.

Run `./build_roms.sh` to build the ROMs, which will be placed
into `dist/`. If successful, you should see output like this:

```

```

Extractors
----------

The `extractors/` directory contains utilities to extract
ROM BASIC and fonts from the ROMs generated by `build_roms.sh`.
You can run `check_roms.sh` and if successful, it will generate
the following programs which can be assembled to generate an
identical binary as extracted from the ROMs.

```
ROMBASIC.ASM    32kB of IBM BASIC C1.10
FONT8X8.ASM     Low 128 characters of IBM 8x8 font
FONT8X8V.ASM    256 characters of IBM 8x8 font
FONT8X16.ASM    256 characters of IBM 8x16 font
OLDF8X16.ASM    IBM 8x16 font with older design of 0, etc.
```

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is in `doc/`, including a memory map.

Disassembly
-----------

An attempt at disassembly is in `bios/`. The first attempt at
this is oriented towards the oldest BIOS (68X1645).
